# CSGO Spread Control using Arduino MEGA and Python 3.8
Using Arduino MEGA ADK and Python 3.8

Inspiration: https://github.com/jcldf/ak47SprayControl/blob/master/sprayControl.ino
- His project is just possible using Arduino Leonardo or Arduino Due, so i changed the method, but it's the same idea and values

## Dependences

- [pySerial](https://pythonhosted.org/pyserial/)
- [pynput](https://pypi.org/project/pynput/)

```
pip install pySerial
pip install pynput
```

*This project is just 4fun and i'll never use this in a real match*
